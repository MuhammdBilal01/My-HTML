            <h3>Details</h3>
            <p>I'm currently doing my bachelors in computer science from Iqra University. The reason for choosing
                computer science was my interest in computer. The love for computer games, as i grow up my interest
                developed in how these programs worked and how they are built. Currently I'm doing my practice in java
                language and learning Selenium as well as learing HTML. </p>
