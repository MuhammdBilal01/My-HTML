        <h3>Power Bank</h3>
        <p>In our applied physics class, our teacher assigned a group project, and we chose to create a power bank from
            scratch. This hands-on endeavor allowed us to apply theoretical knowledge to practical construction, delving
            into circuitry, energy storage, and power management. Through close collaboration, we successfully built a
            functional power bank, merging theoretical understanding with real-world application. This project not only
            enhanced our grasp of applied physics but also sparked a newfound interest in the practical applications of
            our studies.</p>

        <h3>Arduino Based Solenoid Security Door Look</h3>
        <p>In our programming fundamentals class, our group undertook an engaging project centered around creating an
            Arduino-based solenoid security door lock. With a creative touch, we designed the lock in the form of a
            locker crafted from wood. Our innovative solution incorporated a 4x4 keypad, a solenoid lock, a 4x16 LED
            screen, and an Arduino adapter. Leveraging the power of open-source collaboration, we found a foundational
            code online and skillfully tailored it to meet our specific project requirements. Through this hands-on
            experience, we not only deepened our understanding of programming fundamentals but also honed our skills in
            adapting existing code to suit real-world applications. The project showcased the intersection of
            creativity, programming, and practical problem-solving.</p>
